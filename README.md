### About  
Spraykatz is a tool without any pretention able to **retrieve credentials** on large Active Directory networks. It tries to __filelessly procdump__ machines and __parse dumps locally__ in order to **avoid detections** by antivirus softwares as much as possible.

### Installation

#### Ubuntu
```bash
apt update
apt install -y python3.6 python3-pip nmap
```
Next, simply install requirements.
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
